# TokSwap Guide

### Introduction

Welcome to an automated on-chain marketplace based entirely on smart contracts. Our goal is to help developers and users achieve a fast value exchange in the world of Elastos.

Since this project is cloned from the Uniswap V2 code, you can read about it on the official Uniswap website or other related introductory articles on the web, TokSwap is identical to Uniswap V2 from an operational point of view.
